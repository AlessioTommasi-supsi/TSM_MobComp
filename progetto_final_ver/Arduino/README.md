Smart Key Finder and Usage Tracker 
Problem: Misplacing keys is a common issue, and thereâ€™s no easy way to check who used shared keys or when.
Solution: A device that tracks the location and usage of physical keys using BLE technology and an integrated accelerometer.
Features:
Hardware: A small BLE-enabled key fob that attaches to keyrings. It logs movement when keys are picked up and tracks their last known location.
App: Displays usage history (e.g., who last took the keys via profile linkage) and the real-time location of the keys within a certain radius.
Unique Touch: Ideal for shared environments (offices, roommates). The app can integrate with user accounts for accountability and even log keys left behind via geofencing.
